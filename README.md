# common-actors
This is a simple Python3 script that returns common actors of 2 movies specified by the user.
It uses the **IMDbPY** python package.
I created this script because I couldn't remember the name of an actor, but I could think of 2 movies that he was in. This script found the Actor for me. 

It is very simple to use...

Simply:
- Install IMDbPY
 `pip3 install IMDbPY`
- Run the script
    `python3 common-actors.py`

Example:

    `user@pc:~/projects/common-actors$ python3 common-actors.py 
    Enter your first movie: Kill Bill 1
    Enter your second movie: Pulp fiction
    First movie found:  Kill Bill: Vol. 1
    Second movie found:  Pulp Fiction
    Common actors found  1 : 
    Uma Thurman`
